        "# **Hadron Decomposition with the setScreen Algorithm for Targeted Particle Search in Quark-Gluon Plasmas**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Given that the quarks and gluons in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) are no longer bound to discrete particles but are *in a freely flowing state within the QGP's dense medium*, the [usual particle identification methods](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1085/4/042023/meta) involving re-creating 3D particle tracks from hits on the detectors' silicon screens or per-particle energy measurements break down.\n",
        "\n",
        "* As such, it would be more efficient *to use the unique compositions of energy signatures detectable within the charged QGP to catalog and characterise the specific hadrons contained in it*. To achieve this, we propose **the [Stress-Energy Tensor] (set)Screen algorithm.**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The setScreen algorithm uses the characteristic *stress energy tensors of known hadrons* like the various quarks, leptons and bosons to account for their energy signatures within any given charged plasma and to thus isolate any unknown hadrons by the energy signatures they exert within the QGP. **Charged plasmas can thus be analysed via a hadron decomposition process into known and unknown hadrons by their respective energy signatures as mediated by their stress-energy tensors.**\n",
        "\n",
        "* setScreen's hadron decomposition on charged plasmas can thus efficiently isolate any novel hadrons generated from HEP events from the wide-array of energy measurements taken at the point of collision. The fact that such hadron decomposition threads can be parallelised and scaled in relation to the available compute resources means that particle identification can scale efficiently with compute to help process the immense data that such HEP events generate."
